Hello (Contact Name),

I’m William Clift, one of the developers at Midwestern Interactive who has been working on the website for (Client Company Name). I’m currently putting together the "About Us" page, but I’m in need of some additional content in order to wrap it up. Would you be able to send over:

	• photos of the (Company Name) founders and staff (in .jpg or .png format, if possible) and
	
	• a brief 2-3 paragraph description of the company, its story, and its mission


Thank you so much for your assistance. Please let me know if you have any questions!

Best,
William Clift

# code test
See the attached HTML file. I used Bootstrap, which is what I know best, although I'm familiar with plain HTML and CSS as well. My knowledge of JavaScript and PHP is pretty minimal (I've started introductory courses on Codecademy for each), so I definitely didn't do the puzzle correctly. I can declare a variable with the best of 'em, though! Given some time, I'm sure I could learn them.

# thank you very much for considering me!
